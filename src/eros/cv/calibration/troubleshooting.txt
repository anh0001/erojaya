playbackcontrol action groups do not respon to selection changes signal,
we solve this by replacing "selected" to "triggered" signal.

example:

connect(
		sourceGroup, SIGNAL(selected(QAction*)),
		SLOT(selectSource(QAction*))
	); 
replaced with,

connect(
		sourceGroup, SIGNAL(triggered(QAction*)),
		SLOT(selectSource(QAction*))
	);
